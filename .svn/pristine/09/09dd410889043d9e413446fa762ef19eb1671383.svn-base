  <h1> GWAVA Frequently Asked Questions</h1>
  

<h3>How do I change the colors?</h3>
Under the preferences menu, almost all the colors in the display can
be modified.  When you close the main window, the colors will be saved
until next time.

<h3>Can I save the main plot?</h3>
Under the Capture menu, "Capture main plot to clipboard" will copy the
image and you can then paste it into word or powerpoint as an image.
Youc an also save the image to a file using the other menu item.

<h3>How do I export the data?</h3>
Using the Table panel on the main window, all the results (genes and
models) that have been retrieved can be used to create tables of the
results.  These can be exported as text files that can be loaded in
Excel.  There is additionally a model x gene table available through
the Heat Map panel (see that question).

<h3> What does the heat map do?</h3>
If you are trying to understand 50 genes and 50 models, that is a lot
of data.  You can use the heat map to identify trends across models or
genes, or simply for selection.  A color scheme shows the darker
colors as higher -log p-values.  Double-clicking on a particular cell
will display the plot in the main window.  The number in the heat maps
corresponds to the function shown at the bottom of the window.  There
are four functions: max, min, mean, and median.  Each operates on the
TopN subset of the SNPs that are within the specified radius of the
gene or SNP.  The maximum value within 100K of the gene would be
Maximum-<any of the TopN>, radius=100000.  To look at the 3rd highest
  value within 50K of the gene: Minimum, Top-3, 50000.  To create a
  table of SNP values across all models: any function, top-1,
  radius=0.  These tables can be exported.


<h3> How to create a table of SNP values across all models?</h3>
The heat map provides this functionality.  Please refer to that
section.

<h3> How to create heatmap or thumbnails on just a subset of
  data?</h3>
Highlight the particular subset in the Gene Model Selection table and
  then click the corresponding button below.  The default is to
  include all the data.

<h3>How to zoom in on a particular gene?</h3>
Right-clicking on the axis will bring up a zoom menu.  The easiest
approach is to left-click and drag a region on the axis.  Note that if
you zoom out, there is no additional data.  The only data available is
what you searched for initially.  

<h3>If I searched for a gene-model with 10000 radius and then search
  with a different radius, what happens?</h3>
The original data for any gene-model will be wiped out and replaced
  with the new data regardless of the radius.

<h3>Why bother using a radius at all in the search?</h3>
The scientists have requested this feature to identify general hills
of p-values rather than isolated points.  This provides a stronger set
of evidence than numeric value alone.

<h3>What's this averaging filter width?</h3>
If you display multiple models for a single gene in the plot, the dots
become somewhat unmanageable.  The idea was to provide a smoothing
curve to show the values. The wider the width, the smoother the data.
Be sure that the "Show average lines" box is checked.

<h3>Can I add a horizontal line as a guide?</h3>
Yes, click ont he "Add Line" button on the lower panel of the main
Results table.  The line can be assigned a color and style and will
occur in the current plot, all plots, or other subsets.  The lines can
also be edited depending on the context.

<h3>If I resize the window, the dots look weird.</h3>
Yes, click on the Adjust Img button.

<h3>The dots are too small to print.  Can I change them?</h3>
To show the hundreds of SNPs in a single screen and have it be
interactive, we have kept fairly small dots.  However, for printing
you can use the "Print Ready" button that will turn them into circles
very similar to the non-interactive LocusZoom program.

<h3>Can you link this to the UCSC browser</h3>
If you right click on any of the genes in the annotation panel below
the main plot, it will take you to this web page.

<h3>I only care about -log P-values > 5.  How can I throw out the
  rest?</h3>
For the plot, you can highlight the desired range on the left Y-axis
  and zoon to that range.  For the tables, there is a filter function
  that will remove the data for exporting.

<h3>What is the Bands Interval on the Thumbnails?</h3>
All the thumbnails are on the same scale, but due to space
constraints, we have not included a Y-axis.  The bands intervals
provides a measure of scale so that every 1,2,4,5, or 8 -log10 p-value
units, the color of the background will switch colors, depending on
the Preferences colors.

<h3>How does the Y-axis scale work?</h3>

For the standard selection from the Gene Model Selection table, the
intent is to show the zoomed scale so it modifies the scale to show
the full range of the data as clearly as possible.  In contrast, the
thumbnail plots are all on the same scale since the intent is to
compare the models or genes.  Some users have requested that the
vertical scale be fixed as much as possible.  The Preferences Menu has
an "Ideal Max -logPval" setting.  If the range is less than this
specified value, the Y-value will go from 0 to the ideal max.  If the
range extends beyond this, the full range will be shown.  

<h3>How do I find which dot is my SNP?</h3>
On the Results panel, there is a search button that will find SNPs or
genes (that may be hidden).  The "rs" prefix is optional.  A circle
will be placed around the SNP, or the gene will be highlighted.

<h3>I requested 100000 radius but the X-axis shows a larger scale.
  Why?</h3>
If a gene goes from 111111 to 112222 the radius is added to each side
  for the purpose of search.  A 10K radius would give 121111 to
  122222.  For display purposes, we round the data out to the nearest
  meaningful units although there will not be any data for that padded
  region.  If you go further out through a zoom-out we have grayed out
  regions that clearly show the limits.  However, to make a pretty
  picture, we have not made such a distinction of the end of the data
  range for purely aesthetic reasons.

<h3>Why is there no legend</h3>
For reasons of space, we have not included a legend.  The colors are
displayed models are in the Gene Model Selection table.  Users can
create a legend for printing purposes that has colored boxes and
editable names.  This feature is available in the "Capture" menu.

<h3>How do I know if my query is still running?</h3>
The Search History tab in the lower half of the Query tab on the main
panel shows the status of queries.  Essentially, the program goes out
to web service and requests data.  The seconds are counting but will
not be displayed unless you press "Update History".  The status will
shift from Working to Done when they are complete.  Unfortunately,
that is all the information we have.  

<h3>What does GWAVA mean?</h3>
Genome-Wide Association Visual Analyzer.

<h3>Did you know it should be spelled GUAVA?</h3>
We used the fruit icon liberally despite the unaccepted spelling.
