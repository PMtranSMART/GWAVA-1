    <h1>Quick Start Guide to GWAVA</h1>

    <h3>Introduction</h3>
    GWAVA (Genome-Wide Association Visual Analyzer) is a software
    platform for managing searches for particular genes across
    multiple studies.  The goal is to facilitate understanding between
    the gene SNPs (single nucleotide polymorphisms) and the disease or
    phenotype characteristics associated with the studies.  It is
    included as a complement to the tranSMART data warehouse.

    <h3>Loading Data</h3>

    In the Query panel, highlight a set of study/set/model entries in
    the Exclude list and click the "Include" button.  Alternatively,
    double-click single entries in the list.  Since there are many
    models in the Exclude list, enter a key word (case-insensitive) in
    the Filter box.  Next, type in one or more gene names or SNPs.
    This field is case-insensitive and will accept spaces, commas, and
    semicolons as delimiters.  The SNP Annotation Source and Gene
    Annotation Source are set to the defaults.  Rather than return
    just the SNP contained within the gene, one typically extends the
    range by a number of base-pairs on either side.  A reasonable
    number is 100000 base pairs.  Finally, click "Retrieve Data" to
    search for the data.
    <p/>
    The Search History screen indicates the status and duration of the
    searches.  As genes/models are retrieved, the status will switch
    to Done.  If genes are not found, the #SNP Returned column will be
    zero.  Note that the elapsed seconds column will not automatically
    update, but you can use the "Update History".  Typical times are a
    few minutes depending on the number of genes and models
    requested.  As the genes are retrieved, they will populate the
    right table in the "GWAVA Gene Model Selection" window.  Double
    click on the fields of this window to view the Manhattan Plot.

    <h3>Viewing Single Results</h3>
    
    Any gene/model can be viewed by double cliking entries in the
    GWAVA Gene Model Selection table.  These will be displayed in the
    Results panel of the main window.  The X-axis represents a stretch
    of the chromosome and the dots represent individual -log P-values
    for the study shown in the title.  Low p-values suggest a higher
    statistical significance but due to the scale, -log p-values are
    used so that higher values (typically > 8) are considered
    noteworthy.  The Recombination Rate is included as a line on the
    plot as well, governed by the right Y-axis.  
    <P/>
    Users can mouse-over any of the blue-dots to see the particular
    SNP, its -log P-value, the location, and model (if more than 1).
    Below the plot is the annotation panel showing the extent of the
    various genes on the chromosome.  Mousing on SNPs within or near
    the range of the gene will be displayed in different colors.
    Clicking on the gene name (left side) will highlight the gene
    range on the plot.

    <h3>Viewing Multiple Results</h3>
    With the scale of the data, one may want to look at multiple
    models for the same gene range.  Highlight different genes in the
    right table (control or shift-click can also be used).  Then click
    the Multi-Colored Plot button.  For this feature, the same gene
    must be used as it will place many dots on the same gene-range.
    Alternatively, click the Thumbnail Plots to show thumbnails of
    various gene-model plots.  These do not have to be the same gene
    range.  Double clicking on any of tehse thumbnails will display
    the zoomed version in the main Results tab.
